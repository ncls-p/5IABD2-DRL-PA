# Reinforcement Learning Project

This project implements various reinforcement learning algorithms and environments for educational purposes.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source code.
  - `environments/`: Implementations of different game environments.
  - `agents/`: Different RL agent implementations.
  - `metrics/`: Code for calculating and storing performance metrics.
  - `ui/`: User interface for visualizing games.
  - `utils/`: Common utility functions.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests.
- `examples/`: Contains example scripts for training agents and playing games.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run tests: `pytest tests/`

## Usage
